# Simple RootKit

In this project, as my first experience, I involved myself with Kernel functions and tried to implement simple actions like:
- Hiding the module from kernel running modules list
- Hiding any directory which has “rootkit” prefix in it’s name
- Privilege escalation

I used other codes from github, but I tried to understand and learn.
And that was my intention for this project.
